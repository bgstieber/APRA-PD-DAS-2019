# Better Together: Visualizing Annual Giving Efforts to Predict Donor Activity - Knight
 
## Notes 

- Goals of AG
    + Alumni participation, sustainable source of unrestricted revenue, grow donor pipeline for major gifts
- Send surveys to first time donors and long lapsed donors
    + Why don't we do this?
    + If we do this, why don't we have access to it?
- Encountered some problems
    + Build it and they don't come
    + Database not data warehouse
        * Not sure what this was supposed to mean
    + Part-time vs. real-time
- Solution:
    + Offer data in the visualization that is valuable AND cannot be found in the database (short-term and long-term)
        * How to get others to trust the data in the dashboard as much as they do in the database?
- Contact recipe: sequence, timing, number of contacts before gift 
    + I wonder how we could do something similar with our own data?
