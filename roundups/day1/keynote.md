## Followup/Other Notes

- During the presentation, there was moment for a discussion about "what do you wish your senior management knew about you and your work". Conversations lasted a long time, and covered a few common issues
    + Trust the data
    + Data is only as good as information being put into the system
    + Timing
    + Definition of requirements
    + Relying on what we've done in the past is not going to get us where we want to go next

My question is: why are these problems and why do they continue to be problems? I've heard similar comments since starting at WFAA. Are analysts/researchers/data scientists helpless? What needs to be done to solve/move forward at least one of these issues?
