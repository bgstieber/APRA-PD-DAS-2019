# The Advancement Ecosystem - Pairing Engagement with Giving - Teff & Parman
 
## Notes 

- Engagement ecosystem
    + Affiliate (ticket buyer, parents, patients, traveler, events), major giver, volunteer, annual giver
- Got ticket data for performing arts center, matched 13K in CRM
    + Could we get similar data from campus event sites?
- Segment by score, action by cell (two axes: spending and # of tickets for a performing arts center)
    + After segmentation, refined further by sorting
- Used analytics for a direct mail effort for athletics
    + Recognition levels: $10K and $5K
    + Segments: below $5K, $5K, and $10K
    + Built a model to predict if a donor gave over $1K or $15K
    + Good example of how they collaborated with stakeholders and used results from a predictive model to improve
- Engaged: participate or become involved
    + An outward activity a constituent does
        * Attend event, buy a ticket, volunteering, mentoring students, etc.
        * NOT a scholarship, award, honorary degree, athletic letter winner
    + Four broad categories of engagement identified by CASE: volunteer, philanthropic, experiential, and communication (opening emails)
- Engagement scorecard
    + \# of alums, donors, events, affiliates, engaged
    + Found that about 51% of alumni are engaged (but trending downward)
- Identified and pulled engagement attributes from about 12 different categories
    + Then tried to look at recency and frequency for these engagement attributes (where possible)
- Engagement score work resulted in a "single value index measuring an individual's engagement with UI"
    + Seems like another scorecard model
- Engagement data may be "hidden" due to campus not sharing all its data. Need to collaborate with campus to identify and uncover these sources
- Created an engagement heatmap, one dot per county. size of dot correlated with number of alumni, color correlated with engagement score
    + Used to identify best locations for events across the country
- Created an engagement radar chart, which explained the engagement score for a single constituent
- Built a "local" engagement score, based on academic units
    + Made a scatter plot of overall engagement score vs local engagement score
- Went after social media, used EverTrue as a vendor
    + Went through an example of digging into the details for a very engaged household on facebook (most involved with athletics)

## Key Takeaways 

- Collaborated with stakeholders to build predictive models and use them
    + Seems like they had a good amount of runway to performt his analysis
- Still a little unclear on how they built the score, but they did consult a wide array of engagement variables, and took a very methodical approach
- Used conservative matching with social media data
    + Used social media data in a variety of ways
        * Annual giving, digital communication (social ambassadors), alumni engagement, events, prospect development (30 new prospects, 15 in qual, 1 ask made), tracking 15 __campus__ facebook pages
