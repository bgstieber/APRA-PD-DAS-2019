# Using Data Effectively: Beyond Art & Science - Parker
 
## Notes 

- Three elements of data science
    + Data and methods
    + Tooling
    + Narrative or product
- Things you need to do data science well that no one tells you about
    + Tooling
        * Systems engineering, data flowing through each part of the data science process
        * You are designing a system
            - How can you get from point A to point B with as little error as possible
            - Care about avoiding system failures
        * Operations
            - Don't blame the operator, blame the system
                + Blameless postmortems
            - System iteration
                + Identify incident and record
                + Research what others have done
                + Consider ROI (how much effort is this worth?)
    + Data and Methods
        * Data collection is an underrated part of data science
        * Can you take efforts to improve your data quality or collect more of it?
    + How to hone your design abilities
        * Consume and participate
            - Understand and empathize with what people do
        * Purposeful practice
        * Give your right brain space
            - The a-ha shower moment comes from right brain, when left side (analytical) is on autopilot 
        * Cultivate empathy
