# Relationship Mapping with Tableau and R - Douglas

(lightning talk ~ 20min)
 
## Notes 

- Relationship mapping
    + Recorded relationships
        * Connections to major gift prospects, trustee connections, honorees
    + Event attendees
        * Who attended an event together?
            - Considerations: size of an event, remove development officers, remove spousal connections
    + Peer screenings
        * Color lines based on response type, overlap between the pool screened
    + Fundraiser collaboration
        * DoD -> prospect network (visits or interactions), where's the overlap? is the overlap a thing we want?
- Want to avoid clutter in a relationship map
    + This is why tableau is good
- Default formatting of a network visualization can be "scary" (hairball)
    + Pay attention to aesthetics and layout


## Key Takeaways 

- If provided with the right type of data, Tableau can make an informative network visualization
