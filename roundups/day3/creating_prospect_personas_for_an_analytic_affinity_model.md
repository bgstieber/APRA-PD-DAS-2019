# The Many Faced Gods Has Many Names: Creating PRospect Personas for an Analytic Affinity Model - OConnor and Veron
 
## Notes 

- Past affinity scores fell short
    + I think affinity score refers to a general likelihood to engage model
    + Previous score was a weighted average of a few other scores
- Created a GOLD score
    + Giving, ownership, linkage, demonstrated commitment
    + Crowdsourced design
- Scores didn't tell the full story, needed to create strategic action
- Visit likelihood
    + Likelihood to take a visit, how did they do that?
- How to handle individuals in the "middle of the zone"?
- Segments
    + High capacity ($100K+ capacity)
    + High "G Score"
    + High "demonstrated commitment"
        * Taken a visit, attended event, serves on a philanthropic committee
- Put names to different parts of the likelihood/capacity matrix
    + Matrix was actually composed of three separate components
    + Could be a cool tableau visualization
        * Row: capacity, columns: likelihood then visit/readiness/affinity "score"
- Created a research cheatsheet for each persona segment (there were 8) 
    + __Every constituent had a persona__
 
## Key Takeaways 

- They were able to generate score personas for each constituent, how could we do this?
    + Allows for the creation of interesting handouts for development officers
- Their creation and usage of easy to remember and easy to understand names for personas led to strong adoption and buy-in
- They refresh their score nightly, second instance I heard of this
    + Reasoning was "why not?"
- Second score I heard about which was the scorecard based design
    + Not machine learning
- Visit likelihood score?
- Not every measure of involvement needs to be a model, could just sum up relationships/interactions/solicit codes to measure ability to visit
- This would be a good slide deck to get
- Linkages to university?
- Tracking score changes, using this information to guide strategy
- Schedule a communications plan to roadshow, socialization, and visualization were key to winning over early champions
- Growth in giving
    + % of giving in last 5 years occurring last two years or whatever
