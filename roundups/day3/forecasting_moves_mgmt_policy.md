# Partnering with Gift Officers: Forecasting, Moves Management, and EStablishing a Policy - Pagano
 
## Notes 

- Developed understanding of key portfolio details
    + Normal MG timeframe, how many is too many, what do you have to work with, what can you improve
- SJU considers a major gift to be $50K paid over 5 years
- Prospect management guides entire development process, even assigning new prospects
- Reason to unassign
    + At least 5 documented attempts to contact through various channels over a 6 month period and no response
        * Industry standard
        * What would our data say about this?
    + Prospect has been met with and disqualified
    + The prospect is better managed by another gift officer
- Ratings
    + Research 
        * Capacity for a gift over 5 years; based on reliable information: real estate, stock, salary, ...; does not consider inclination
    + Officer qualified
        * Capacity for a gift over 5 years; based on data learned through interaction/willingness to give to your institiution; can be a general no capacity/no inclination
- Pipeline management
    + When will the ask happen? When will the gift close? How much?
- Moves management
    + Wasn't working: identify, qualify, cultivate, solicit, steward
    + Tweaked: identify, qualify, cultivate (pre project/plan), cultivate (in project/plan), solicit, steward (circular process)
    + Defined each stage: what's the goal? what tools are needed to reach that goal?
    + Moving through stages is dictated by specific targets, doesn't allow for skipping ahead; allows for easy reporting and tracking
        * Set the system up to prevent improper moves management
 
## Key Takeaways 
 
- Wasn't exactly what I was expecting as far as moves management goes
- Interesting ideas about more closely monitorning the work of development officers
    + They have a prospect management policy that is accessible to all users
- They track and report on days in stage, and use this data to recommend actions for development officers (e.g. is there an event they should be invited to?)
- Provide research service based on a plan stage
    + Sets expectations and allows research to focus on finding new prospects and prioritizing further actions

## Other Details / Follow Up 
 
- Subscription box of RIDPs for development officers?
    + Do they need more prospects?
    + I think they need more insight into what the correct "move" is. How do we find data to do that?
    + Attribution modeling, went to a talk at PAW about this
- __They read every contact report__
    + DoDs put in interesting data about constituents, and this data can be helpful to enter into the system
        * Could build an algorithm to predict this and prioritize contact reports to be read by staff
            - Just need labeled contact reports
- What was the ROI on this?
