## Notes 
 
- Embracing your uniqueness
    + what about your org makes you unique? what data points can you harness that other organizations may not have? do you have a cyclical influx of new donors? what regular events do you hold that could get maximized?
- Building a gift table
    + overall goal and lead gift, commitments made to date, projections, gift ranges, # of suspects, # of prospects, and/or # donors needed at gift range, # of donors to date
- Best practices
    + Lead gift = at least 10% of goal
    + Top 10-20 gifts = half the goal
    + Top 10-20% of donors = 80% of goal
    + __Approx. half of goal is raised during silent/quiet phase__
    + Suspect to Prospect to Donor ratios
        * Minimum - 10:3:1

        * Utilize previous campaign information to determine appropriate rate for your organization
