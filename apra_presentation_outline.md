# APRA PD DAS 2019 Presentation Outline

APRA: Association of Professional Researchers for Advancement 

PD: Prospect Development

DAS: Data Analytics Symposium

## Preface

Brad is giving a presentation in Phoenix, AZ on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

The title of Brad's talk is __Generating Insights from Clustering Large Donors__. This is the description of the talk:

> Stakeholders frequently ask questions like “what other donors look like this group?” or “what is the pathway to elevated giving?” Clustering techniques within the class of unsupervised learning methods let analysts generate insights into these questions for their most generous donors, even without a dependent variable they are trying to predict. 

> In this talk, the presenter will discuss a variety of clustering techniques, how and when the techniques can be applied, and how the results from clustering algorithms can be used. Segmenting an organization’s most generous donors into distinct groups can allow fundraisers, researchers, and analysts approach these important constituents in more targeted and personalized ways.

> Additionally, the presenter will comment on some of the larger trends in fundraising. These trends include the increasing concentration of giving, the continued deviation from the 80/20 Pareto principle, and the potential disruption in philanthropy caused by the ultra-wealthy.

__Important Dates__:

- __MONDAY MAY 20__: Email draft PowerPoint to speaker liaison (assigned in March) & schedule call to discuss

## Presentation Outline

The talk is scheduled for 60 minutes, which means we should present for about 45-50 minutes, and leave 10-15 minutes for questions. This works out to about 20-30 slides of content.

 - Background and Context
     + Who am I, what do I do, where do I work
         * Always important to provide context about "size of shop"
     + Large donors have always been important, but economic trends show that as wealth continues to concentrate, it's more important now than ever to learn as much as we can about this group.
 - What is Unsupervised Learning
 - Three Clustering Algorithms You Should Know
     + kmeans
     + hierarchical clustering
     + DBSCAN

 - An Example from WFAA
     + 5ish slides on Large Donor Clustering
     + Important to describe how it was done (what was the data?), what the results were, how to generate insights (asking better questions) and next steps
 - Bonus: Large Donor Disruption in Philanthropy
     + "Get real" about growing inequalities and how this affects philanthropy
     + reference the Wealth_X_World_Ultra_Wealth_Report_2018_FINAL.pdf report
     + Pareto (80/20) principle in philanthropy
         * WFAA example
         * Political giving
